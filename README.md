# React exercise 1

This is the first exercise in a series.
The description of the subtasks can be found also in App.js as comments:

- Import and include the "Test" component already created in the Components folder.

- Create a new component here named "HelloWorld" that simply prints out "Hello, World!" in an h2.

- Create a second component (you can name it however you want) that has an h3 and a <p> below that.

- Create a "Greeter" component that prints out "Hello" followed by a name. It should receive the name as a prop.

- Create a "CityDetails" component that takes the city object above as props and then displays its properties, including the image as an actual img.

- Map over the numbers array, create a "NumberDisplay" component dynamically. Pass the number with the prop name "NumberDisplay" actually requires.
